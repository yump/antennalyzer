Antennalyzer
============

#swr_optimizer

Program for selecting a set of antennas to use, from a subset of
antennas that are availiable, using VSWR measurements.

#swr_recorder

Program for gathering VSWR data about a set of antennas.  Supports
dual-mode antennas (swtichable polarization was my use case).  Rather
hackish.
